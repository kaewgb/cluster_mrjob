MRJOb MapReduce specializer for hcook's gmm cluster example.
Still under development.

3 parts of specializing:
train() - working (using file pointer)
all_pairs_BIC_score() - working
segment_majority_vote() - working (1/2 using file pointer)

Note:
- cluster_bicmrjob.py = all_pairs_BIC_score.py, it just doesn't rely on our MapReduce backend.
- cluster_mrtemplate.py is kind of our new (temporary) MapReduce backend.
- Need to mute output from CodePy and ASP
- Need to modify gmm_specializer package -> add one more parameter in calls to ASPTemplate.Template(), either disable_unicode=False or bytestream_passthrough=True
